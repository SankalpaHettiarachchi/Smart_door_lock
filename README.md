I have developed a web application for our Robotic Society at Rajarata University of Sri Lanka as an academic project. The main goal is to raise awareness of the society among students

## Fetures

- Students can register with their university email addresses.
- Email notifications are sent for website updates.
- An admin panel is available to control the site's content (CMS).
- Super admin can manage access permissions."
